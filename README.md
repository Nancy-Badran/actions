This is a collection of [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) that use and that I experiment with :smile:

* [GoCenter](./gocenter): An action to build Go apps using Go modules resolved from [GoCenter](https://gocenter.jfrog.com/stats)
* [JFrog CLI](./jfrog-cli): An action that makes use of [JFrog Artifactory](https://jfrog.com/artifactory)
* [JFrog CLI (Go)](./jfrog-cli-go): An action that makes use of [JFrog Artifactory](https://jfrog.com/artifactory) and has [Go](https://golang.org) installed
* [sh](./sh): A shell action, forked from the official repository with a few added packages
